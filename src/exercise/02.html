  <!-- 🐨 add React and ReactDOM on the page.
       💰 Here are script tags that'll do the job:
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  -->
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

  <script type="module">
    const reactElement = document.getElementById('root')

    // You're going to re-implement this code using React!
    // 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
    // These three lines are similar to React.createElement
    const element = React.createElement('div', 
    {id: 'element-id', className: 'container', children: ['Hello', ' ', 'Wordl!']}
    )
    // 💰 in React, you set this with the "children" prop
    // 💰 in React, this is also called the "className" prop
    // This is similar to ReactDOM.render
    ReactDOM.render(element, reactElement)
    // 🐨 Please re-implement the regular document.createElement code above
    // with these React API calls
    // 💰 The example in the markdown file should be a good hint for you.
